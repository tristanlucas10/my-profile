				<h1>Hello, My name is Tristan</h1>

					<p>
						I am 18 years old. I was born in New York City to my German mother and my Hungarian father. When I was seven years old, I moved to Los Angeles and lived there till I finished high school. Once I finished high school, I started higher education in Paris, France, at ESSEC Business School. Ever since I was four years old, my main hobby has been playing and studying football. This love for the game is why I am working toward becoming a professional football manager.

				<h2><strong>Student Life</strong></h2>
					<p>
					  My life now is something that I couldn’t have imagined a year ago. I had never been to France till last summer and now I am living right next to the capital. Paris was so much more than I thought it would be. From the stereotypes to the riots, I had low expectations for Paris, but when I arrived I couldn't believe it. The architecture at every corner astounds me and the vibe of the city is amazing. However, I do live around 40 minutes away by train, but I still love to walk around the city with my friends and experience different foods and activities. At ESSEC, I have met so many amazing people from different corners of the world and made true friendships. With all the international students, you get an idea of how the world really is and how connected we really can be. I love my life at ESSEC and I am trying my best to lead a healthy and educated student life.

				<h2><strong>Football</strong></h2>
					<p>
					  My connection with football started in the United States at the age of four, induced by my Hungarian father and German mother. Over the course of fifteen years, I have developed and am continuously improving my understanding of the world of football in a variety of ways. I have served as team captain and guided my teams to championships, the highlight being the California State Championship. I also had the good fortune to work as an assistant coach, which offered me the opportunity to develop my exercise planning, practice leading, and game preparation skills. I also studied the science of how to improve the physical and mental development of athletes during my internship at the American coaching company, Modern Age Warriors. I observed processes that involved players from Borussia Dortmund, the Los Angeles Lakers, St. Pauli, and Fehérvár FC. This helped me understand the significance of another aspect of coaching requirements related to lifestyle. With my love for the game, my playing and coaching background, and my ESSEC education, I am supporting my ultimate goal of becoming a professional football manager at one of the top football clubs in the world.

				<h2><strong>Travelling</strong></h2>
					<p>
					  Having started to travel ever since I was five months old, traveling around the world has always been a part of me. With my grandparents and family living in Europe, my younger brother and I flew over to Europe every summer and winter to visit them, all the while seeing the world. Once I became older, I traveled to more bizarre places like Peru and Norway, to name a few. I have been to over 20 different countries with different cultures which entices me to travel. The interest in travel also fueled my dream in becoming a professional football manager where I would travel the world doing the things I love. I hope to travel to even more bizarre places and experience things I could never imagine.

				<h2><strong>Skiing</strong></h2>
					<p>
					  When I first started hitting the slopes, I was taught by my mother and grandfather. My mother was the second best skier her age in all of East Germany when she was younger and my grandfather was a skiing instructor for most of his life. They started me as soon as I could start walking and I have loved it ever since. Living in Los Angeles most of my life, I couldn’t ski often, but when I have the chance, I try and improve every time and try new things. I hope to ski very soon and feel how the snow hits my skis again.
